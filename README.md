### How to use?

1. Download any json format sheet for sky from [here](https://specy.github.io/skyMusic/) as an example
2. Open the app and press the **Add music** button and select the music sheet file (you can add multiple songs). You can also just put files in the `app_location/music/songs` folder (it can be changed in settings)
3. Choose the music from the list and press 'Start'. After that the app will wait for you to press a start keybind while in the game. Then press pause keybind to stop the music while it is playing (**V** and **B** by deafult). You can change both keybinds in the settings.
4. Press the **Edit** button and change the music speed in **BPM**
